## Information
The top of the application will display your wallet's total and will be green for profit or red for loss. Below is a simple table showing your wallet's **initial balance** and the amount of change to the current balance.

Below that is the highest & lowest balances of your wallet as well as a graph showing your balance over the last 2 months.
